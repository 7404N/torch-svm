torch-svm/liblinear
===================

Reimplementation of Leon Bottou's svmsgd and svmasgd.
I would suggest using Leon's stuff (http://leon.bottou.org/projects/sgd)
This implementation is 2-10 times slower :) depending on the sparsity.

```
git clone git://github.com/koraykv/torch-svm.git
cd torch-svm
torh-pkg deploy liblinear
```
